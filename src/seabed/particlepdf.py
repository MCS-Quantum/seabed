class ParticlePDF:
    """
    A probability distribution class defined by a finite set of 
    discrete 'particles' in arbitrary dimensions. Each particle
    has an associated weight corresponding with the probability.
    This class has methods associated with the updating of the 
    particle weights from likelihoods and observed data, sampling
    from the distribution and 'resampling' the distribution. 

    Warnings:
        The number of samples (i.e. particles) required for good performance
        will depend on the application.  Too many samples will slow down the
        calculations, but too few samples can produce incorrect results.
